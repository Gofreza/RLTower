## 🧙‍♂️ About the Project

This is a rogue-like game built in C++, inspired by classic and modern dungeon crawlers like COGMIND. The game emphasizes procedural generation, turn-based mechanics, and deep gameplay customization. The ultimate goal is to create a challenging yet rewarding experience for players who enjoy exploration, strategy, and a bit of luck.

The goal here is to roam inside a tower and try to get to the top.

## 🧝‍♂️ Lore and Story

*Here is a basic overview of the story*

You are a convicted prisoner, given a choice: serve your sentence behind bars or attempt the perilous challenge of conquering the infamous **Prisoner Tower**. Legend has it that anyone who reaches the top will earn their freedom. But beware—the tower is no ordinary place. It teems with deadly monsters and the desperate souls of those who tried and failed before you, transforming it into a living dungeon.

Will you face the tower's horrors alone, or seek allies to increase your chances of survival? The choice is yours.
